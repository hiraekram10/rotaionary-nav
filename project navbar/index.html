            <p>Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916â€“1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio
                Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine,
                rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake
                of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times
                after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in
                1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in
                1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed
                under the control of the group's Audi division</p>

            <p>As of the 2018 model year, Lamborghini's automobile product range consists of three model lines, two of
                which are mid-engine two-seat sports cars while the third one is a front engined, all-wheel drive SUV
